## What Mintbean does.

We have helped thousands of developers in their career journeys. We've hosted 150+ hackathons and workshops that have drawn attendees from 100+ cities across North America. We've strived to expose our community to deep insights from the industry. Among our guest speakers, we've had software engineers and representatives from top-tier companies like Netflix, Tesla, Auth0, MongoDB as well open source projects like RedwoodJS and Blitz JS. We've also performed career coaching, resume reviews, 1-on-1 mentoring and interview training for hundreds of developers. We regularly hire members from the community as well.

## How the Full Stack Career Accelerator can help you.

Our system helps you ace the job hunt with methods of approaching resume screening, technical screening, non-technical screening, and the final technical test.
