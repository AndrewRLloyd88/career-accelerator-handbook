# How to get involved

Getting involved is pretty easy!

## Apply for the Career Accelerator program

Currently, we're accepting applications through our Discord. Reach out to someone and we'll be happy to help you out.

## Get involved in the greater Mintbean community

First things first, make sure you've joined the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/j7CjBAz). That's the fastest way to get in touch with us, too. Here, you can do things like:

- Connect with a community of more than 2,000+ people
- Attend hackathons (either solo or in teams)
- Learn new things through workshops
- Get help on coding and career related questions
- Find support from a group of like-minded individuals
- Discuss web dev with the community
- Show off and celebrate your wins
- Find inspiration and show off your projects

## Attend hackathons

You can find a list of upcoming hackathons at [Mintbean.io](https://mintbean.io). They're easy to get into and are beginner friendly, but are also hard to master. Many developers attend our hackathons just for fun. Others attend to compete and win. Either way, it's a blast, and everybody comes away having learned something new.
